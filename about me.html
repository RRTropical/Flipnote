    <p>Hello! I'm a programmer by the name of Lorenzo. I've always been fascinated by technology and the manner in which it may be applied to the development of fun, original ideas. I've had the chance to work on a variety of projects throughout my time, including creating websites for others and creating specialized software programs. I am knowledgeable in a variety of programming languages, including C#, Python, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Lua, PHP, and a few more. I'm continuously searching for new ways to increase my understanding and proficiency. I like to keep up with the most recent technological advancements and work on my own programming projects in my own time. I also enjoy drawing a lot, which keeps me balanced, and entertained. Many thanks for visiting my about me tab. I hope you have a better understanding of who I am and what I do. If you have any questions or would like to work with me on a project, please don't hesitate to reach out to me (Vortex 2.0#2563) on discord.</p>
